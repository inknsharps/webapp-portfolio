## About

This is a portfolio page that I built for showcasing my deployed web applications from the Columbia Engineering Bootcamp course.

## Features

* Clean minimalistic page design.
* Projects, biographical and contact forms neatly arranged and displayed on one page.
* Fixed navigation bar.
* Hover over project titles.
* Built with mobile first design in mind, so the page is responsive to many screen widths.
* Code related aids such as:
    * Colors and borders defined by `:root` rules for easy theme changes.
    * A `reset.css` for better browser support.
* And some accessibility aids such as:
    * Strikethrough nav links for desktop browsing.
    * Brightly contrasted contact form fields when selected.
